our Project must be using GitHub and you need to make sure each person has their own branch. Also be sure to include your Git Hub Link.

This is a group project, so you will submit a 1 page peer review for each of your group mates. You will also write a 1 page self-reflection on how you think you did.

Your Project must be fully responsive and each member of the team must submit the entire project.
